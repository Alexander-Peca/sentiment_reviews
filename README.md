# sentiment_reviews
This project comprises sentiment analysis of amazon reviews

Main project goal:

Develop a sentiment analysis system for Amazon reviews to classify sentiments, identify recurring themes in user feedback, and validate the alignment between user-provided scores and text sentiment


Sentiment analysis helps extract and quantify the emotions, attitudes, or opinions expressed in text. In the context of product reviews, the key goals and applications include:

Primary Goals
Build a Sentiment Classifier:

Train a machine learning model to classify reviews into sentiment categories (e.g., Positive, Neutral, Negative) based on the Text column.
Why: This demonstrates your ability to preprocess text data, use NLP techniques, and train predictive models.
Validate Sentiment Scores with Text:

Compare sentiment derived from the review Text with the provided Score to validate consistency or detect anomalies.
Why: Shows your ability to analyze relationships between text and numerical data.
Provide Actionable Insights:

Extract actionable insights, such as:
Common issues in negative reviews (e.g., shipping delays, product defects).
Popular features mentioned in positive reviews.
Why: Highlights your ability to turn raw data into business-relevant insights.
Secondary (Optional) Goals
Topic Modeling or Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:

Identify themes or aspects (e.g., price, quality, delivery) in the reviews and determine the sentiment for each aspect.
Why: Demonstrates advanced NLP skills like topic modeling (e.g., LDA) or aspect-based sentiment analysis.
Time-Based Sentiment Trends:

Analyze how sentiment evolves over time (e.g., after product updates or new launches).
Why: Adds a temporal dimension to your analysis, making it more dynamic.
Build a Dashboard or App:

Create a simple web app using Streamlit to display the classifier's results or visualizations.
Why: Showcases your ability to communicate findings interactively, which is highly valuable in real-world projects.
